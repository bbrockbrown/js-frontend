## Get started

### 1. Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

### 2. Set up formatting with Prettier and ESLint

You must make sure ALL your code is
formatted according to our `eslint.config.js` and `.prettierrc` configs. The
best way to make sure you are always sticking to our guidelines is by having
Prettier & ESLint automatically format your code when you save.

#### VSCode (recommended)

When you open this project in VSCode, it will automatically prompt you to
install the recommended extensions from `.vscode/extensions.json`. Click
**Install** on the notification, or install them manually:

1. [Prettier ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint)
   (`rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint`) — formats your code using both Prettier
   and ESLint rules on every save
2. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
   (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`) — shows lint errors and warnings inline as you
   type

Once both are installed, **restart VSCode completely (quit and reopen)**. From
that point on, every file save will automatically format and lint your code.
Format-on-save is configured in `.vscode/settings.json` — do not edit this
file.

To manually format all files at once:

```bash
npx prettier . --write
```

#### Other editors

You are on your own for format-on-save setup. The Prettier config is in
`.prettierrc` and the ESLint config is in `eslint.config.js`.

Find more details about our linting rules [here](#code-formatting-rules)

### 3. Run the app in development mode

```
npm run dev
```

## Additional scripts
Create an optimized production build:

```
npm run build
```

## File organization

Feel free to modify stuff inside the `public` or `src` directories, or the
`README`:

```c
├── public // root html, favicon, and manifest
├── src
│   ├── assets // files that are not code (eg. icons, images)
│   │   └── icons // all icons used in the app (bunch of .svg files)
│   ├── common // stuff that doesn't belong to any one page; shared stuff
│   │   ├── components
│   │   ├── contexts
│   │   ├── hooks // custom hooks
│   │   ├── layouts // for routing
│   │   └── utils // helper functions that are not hooks
│   ├── pages // a folder for every unique page (or set of pages)
│   │   ├── account // user account related pages (login, signup, etc)
│   │   ├── home // homepage
│   │   └── not-found // error page for bad routes
│   ├── App.css // global stylesheet
│   └── App.jsx // global contexts & routing
└── README.md // project documentation
```

Everything else: **DO NOT TOUCH!!!**

- many of these are modified as side-effects of normal development, that's okay
- just never modify these directly

```c
├── .vscode // project-specific settings for VSCode (eg. format on save)
├── build // copy of the project optimized for production
├── node_modules // external libraries and dependencies
├── eslint.config.js // linting config
├── jsconfig.json // JS compiling config
├── package-lock.json // detailed description of the entire dependency tree
├── package.json // project dependencies
└── vite.config.js // Vite build and test config
```

## Code formatting rules

We enforce the following rules across all of our code.  
Code that deviates is always flagged as an error.

** Run `npx prettier . --write` to automatically format files with prettier**

- Only `.jsx` files can have React JSX in them, and all `.jsx` files MUST have
  JSX in them.  
  Empty files are not flagged.
- Always have semicolons at the end of expressions
- Single quotes only
- Line widths around 80, wrapping everything including prose
- Code has a tab width of 2. Editor displays a tab size of 2.
- Imports
  - Unused imports are not allowed
  - Relative import paths are only permitted if the imported file is inside the
    same directory. In all other cases, absolute paths only. `src` is the base
    directory for absolute import paths.
  - Imports are roughly bundled into 3 groups, in this order:
    1. "react"
    2. third party modules (things that dont fit other rules)
    3. absolute paths in `src` (begin with `common` or `pages`)
    4. relative paths (begin with `.` or `/`)
  - Within each import group, imports are sorted alphabetically
  - Line of space between each import group
  - If importing multiple things from one file, items imported are sorted
    alphabetically
  - Imports that don't exist are not allowed
- Plus the default rules in the following eslint plugins:
  - js plugin recommended
  - react plugin recommended
  - import plugin errors
  - prettier plugin recommended

## Credits

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with
various plugins to handle code formatting.

We enforce defining [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) for
all components.

We use [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/home) for client-side routing.

The vast majority of styling is done using
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).
